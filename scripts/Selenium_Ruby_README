Getting Started
Install required Ruby Gems

gem install selenium-webdriver
gem install rspec
gem install rspec_junit_formatter


Install Browser Support to $PATH
This is easiest to do with homebrew on Mac:

 brew install chromedriver


brew install geckodriver
Can also download the exec file and place locally in test folder if required for remote testing where it is not possible to install the drivers to path.

Testing
Call the test and pass results to junit xml

rspec -c <testfile>.rb --format RspecJunitFormatter --out rspec.xml
