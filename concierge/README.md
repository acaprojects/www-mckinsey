# Shared Root Assets

Put files here to copy into the associated frontends.

These got copied into the frontend's root bundle.

To reference them in code, use the associated path of the file.

For an image in `assets/` that lives in the `img` directory, reference its path as if it was 
part of the FE folder.

```html 
<img src="assets/img/mckinsey_lines.svg">
```
